### Hi there 👋

I'm a pharmacist and scientist passionate about how we find and build the next generation of medicines. I spent my PhD diving deep into natural products discovery (#MEMO & #ENPKG), and these days, I’m focused on the math behind the medicine - specifically Bayesian disease modeling and drug development workflows.
